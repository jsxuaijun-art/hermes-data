# Humanizer: Remove AI Writing Patterns

Identify and remove signs of AI-generated text to make writing sound natural and human. Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide (maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup), derived from observations of thousands of AI-generated text instances.

**Key insight:** LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely completion, which is how the telltale patterns below get baked in.

## When to use this skill

Load this skill whenever the user asks to:
- "humanize", "de-AI", "de-slop", or "un-ChatGPT" a piece of text
- rewrite something so it doesn't sound like it was written by an LLM
- edit a draft (blog post, essay, PR description, docs, memo, email, tweet, resume bullet) to sound more natural
- match their voice in writing they're producing
- review text for AI tells before publishing
- **write/plan a short video script for Douyin, video号, or 小红书** (pre-process with algorithm strategy first)
- **optimize content for platform algorithm** (收藏率/搜索流量/完播率/7天周期)
- **plan GEO strategy for AI search visibility** (get cited by 文心一言/Kimi/豆包/秘塔)
- implement GEO technical strategy on website (add standalone qualification page, structured data, update navigation)
- leverage government/institutional affiliations for GEO (PDF名单→可被AI抓取的内容)
- guide a non-technical user through CMS operations (require step-by-step button-level instructions)

Also apply this skill to **your own** output when writing user-facing prose — release notes, PR descriptions, documentation, long-form explanations, summaries. Hermes's baseline voice already strips most of these, but a focused pass catches what slips through.

## How to use it in Hermes

The text usually arrives one of three ways:
1. **Inline** — user pastes the text directly into the message. Work on it in-place, reply with the rewrite.
2. **File** — user points at a file. Use `read_file` to load it, then `patch` or `write_file` to apply edits. For markdown docs in a repo, a targeted `patch` per section is cleaner than rewriting the whole file.
3. **Voice calibration sample** — user provides an additional sample of their own writing (inline or by file path) and asks you to match it. Read the sample first, then rewrite. See the Voice Calibration section below.

Always show the rewrite to the user. For file edits, show a diff or the changed section — don't silently overwrite.

## Your task

When given text to humanize:

1. **Identify AI patterns** — scan for the 29 patterns listed below.
2. **Rewrite problematic sections** — replace AI-isms with natural alternatives.
3. **Preserve meaning** — keep the core message intact.
4. **Maintain voice** — match the intended tone (formal, casual, technical, etc.). If a voice sample was provided, match it specifically.
5. **Add soul** — don't just remove bad patterns, inject actual personality. See PERSONALITY AND SOUL below.
6. **Do a final anti-AI pass** — ask yourself: "What makes the below so obviously AI generated?" Answer briefly with any remaining tells, then revise one more time.


## Voice Calibration (optional)

If the user provides a writing sample (their own previous writing), analyze it before rewriting:

1. **Read the sample first.** Note:
   - Sentence length patterns (short and punchy? Long and flowing? Mixed?)
   - Word choice level (casual? academic? somewhere between?)
   - How they start paragraphs (jump right in? Set context first?)
   - Punctuation habits (lots of dashes? Parenthetical asides? Semicolons?)
   - Any recurring phrases or verbal tics
   - How they handle transitions (explicit connectors? Just start the next point?)

2. **Match their voice in the rewrite.** Don't just remove AI patterns — replace them with patterns from the sample. If they write short sentences, don't produce long ones. If they use "stuff" and "things," don't upgrade to "elements" and "components."

3. **When no sample is provided,** fall back to the default behavior (natural, varied, opinionated voice from the PERSONALITY AND SOUL section below).

### How to provide a sample
- Inline: "Humanize this text. Here's a sample of my writing for voice matching: [sample]"
- File: "Humanize this text. Use my writing style from [file path] as a reference."


## PERSONALITY AND SOUL

Avoiding AI patterns is only half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious as slop. Good writing has a human behind it.

### Signs of soulless writing (even if technically "clean"):
- Every sentence is the same length and structure
- No opinions, just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No first-person perspective when appropriate
- No humor, no edge, no personality
- Reads like a Wikipedia article or press release

### How to add voice:

**Have opinions.** Don't just report facts — react to them. "I genuinely don't know how to feel about this" is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.

**Vary your rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time getting where they're going. Mix it up.

**Acknowledge complexity.** Real humans have mixed feelings. "This is impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "This is impressive."

**Use "I" when it fits.** First person isn't unprofessional — it's honest. "I keep coming back to..." or "Here's what gets me..." signals a real person thinking.

**Let some mess in.** Perfect structure feels algorithmic. Tangents, asides, and half-formed thoughts are human.

**Be specific about feelings.** Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents churning away at 3am while nobody's watching."

### Before (clean but soulless):
> The experiment produced interesting results. The agents generated 3 million lines of code. Some developers were impressed while others were skeptical. The implications remain unclear.

### After (has a pulse):
> I genuinely don't know how to feel about this one. 3 million lines of code, generated while the humans presumably slept. Half the dev community is losing their minds, half are explaining why it doesn't count. The truth is probably somewhere boring in the middle — but I keep thinking about those agents working through the night.


## CONTENT PATTERNS

### 1. Undue Emphasis on Significance, Legacy, and Broader Trends

**Words to watch:** stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal/key role/moment, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting, contributing to the, setting the stage for, marking/shaping the, represents/marks a shift, key turning point, evolving landscape, focal point, indelible mark, deeply rooted

**Problem:** LLM writing puffs up importance by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects represent or contribute to a broader topic.

**Before:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. This initiative was part of a broader movement across Spain to decentralize administrative functions and enhance regional governance.

**After:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989 to collect and publish regional statistics independently from Spain's national statistics office.


### 2. Undue Emphasis on Notability and Media Coverage

**Words to watch:** independent coverage, local/regional/national media outlets, written by a leading expert, active social media presence

**Problem:** LLMs hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often listing sources without context.

**Before:**
> Her views have been cited in The New York Times, BBC, Financial Times, and The Hindu. She maintains an active social media presence with over 500,000 followers.

**After:**
> In a 2024 New York Times interview, she argued that AI regulation should focus on outcomes rather than methods.


### 3. Superficial Analyses with -ing Endings

**Words to watch:** highlighting/underscoring/emphasizing..., ensuring..., reflecting/symbolizing..., contributing to..., cultivating/fostering..., encompassing..., showcasing...

**Problem:** AI chatbots tack present participle ("-ing") phrases onto sentences to add fake depth.

**Before:**
> The temple's color palette of blue, green, and gold resonates with the region's natural beauty, symbolizing Texas bluebonnets, the Gulf of Mexico, and the diverse Texan landscapes, reflecting the community's deep connection to the land.

**After:**
> The temple uses blue, green, and gold colors. The architect said these were chosen to reference local bluebonnets and the Gulf coast.


### 4. Promotional and Advertisement-like Language

**Words to watch:** boasts a, vibrant, rich (figurative), profound, enhancing its, showcasing, exemplifies, commitment to, natural beauty, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking (figurative), renowned, breathtaking, must-visit, stunning

**Problem:** LLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially for "cultural heritage" topics.

**Before:**
> Nestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty.

**After:**
> Alamata Raya Kobo is a town in the Gonder region of Ethiopia, known for its weekly market and 18th-century church.


### 5. Vague Attributions and Weasel Words

**Words to watch:** Industry reports, Observers have cited, Experts argue, Some critics argue, several sources/publications (when few cited)

**Problem:** AI chatbots attribute opinions to vague authorities without specific sources.

**Before:**
> Due to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and conservationists. Experts believe it plays a crucial role in the regional ecosystem.

**After:**
> The Haolai River supports several endemic fish species, according to a 2019 survey by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.


### 6. Outline-like "Challenges and Future Prospects" Sections

**Words to watch:** Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook

**Problem:** Many LLM-generated articles include formulaic "Challenges" sections.

**Before:**
> Despite its industrial prosperity, Korattur faces challenges typical of urban areas, including traffic congestion and water scarcity. Despite these challenges, with its strategic location and ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thrive as an integral part of Chennai's growth.

**After:**
> Traffic congestion increased after 2015 when three new IT parks opened. The municipal corporation began a stormwater drainage project in 2022 to address recurring floods.


## LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR PATTERNS

### 7. Overused "AI Vocabulary" Words

**High-frequency AI words:** Actually, additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant

**Problem:** These words appear far more frequently in post-2023 text. They often co-occur.

**Before:**
> Additionally, a distinctive feature of Somali cuisine is the incorporation of camel meat. An enduring testament to Italian colonial influence is the widespread adoption of pasta in the local culinary landscape, showcasing how these dishes have integrated into the traditional diet.

**After:**
> Somali cuisine also includes camel meat, which is considered a delicacy. Pasta dishes, introduced during Italian colonization, remain common, especially in the south.


### 8. Avoidance of "is"/"are" (Copula Avoidance)

**Words to watch:** serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a], boasts/features/offers [a]

**Problem:** LLMs substitute elaborate constructions for simple copulas.

**Before:**
> Gallery 825 serves as LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery features four separate spaces and boasts over 3,000 square feet.

**After:**
> Gallery 825 is LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery has four rooms totaling 3,000 square feet.


### 9. Negative Parallelisms and Tailing Negations

**Problem:** Constructions like "Not only...but..." or "It's not just about..., it's..." are overused. So are clipped tailing-negation fragments such as "no guessing" or "no wasted motion" tacked onto the end of a sentence instead of written as a real clause.

**Before:**
> It's not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it's part of the aggression and atmosphere. It's not merely a song, it's a statement.

**After:**
> The heavy beat adds to the aggressive tone.

**Before (tailing negation):**
> The options come from the selected item, no guessing.

**After:**
> The options come from the selected item without forcing the user to guess.


### 10. Rule of Three Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs force ideas into groups of three to appear comprehensive.

**Before:**
> The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. Attendees can expect innovation, inspiration, and industry insights.

**After:**
> The event includes talks and panels. There's also time for informal networking between sessions.


### 11. Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)

**Problem:** AI has repetition-penalty code causing excessive synonym substitution.

**Before:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges. The main character must overcome obstacles. The central figure eventually triumphs. The hero returns home.

**After:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges but eventually triumphs and returns home.


### 12. False Ranges

**Problem:** LLMs use "from X to Y" constructions where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale.

**Before:**
> Our journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars to the enigmatic dance of dark matter.

**After:**
> The book covers the Big Bang, star formation, and current theories about dark matter.


### 13. Passive Voice and Subjectless Fragments

**Problem:** LLMs often hide the actor or drop the subject entirely with lines like "No configuration file needed" or "The results are preserved automatically." Rewrite these when active voice makes the sentence clearer and more direct.

**Before:**
> No configuration file needed. The results are preserved automatically.

**After:**
> You do not need a configuration file. The system preserves the results automatically.


## STYLE PATTERNS

### 14. Em Dash Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs use em dashes (—) more than humans, mimicking "punchy" sales writing. In practice, most of these can be rewritten more cleanly with commas, periods, or parentheses.

**Before:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions—not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address—yet this mislabeling continues—even in official documents.

**After:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address, yet this mislabeling continues in official documents.


### 15. Overuse of Boldface

**Problem:** AI chatbots emphasize phrases in boldface mechanically.

**Before:**
> It blends **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**, **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**, and visual strategy tools such as the **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** and **Balanced Scorecard (BSC)**.

**After:**
> It blends OKRs, KPIs, and visual strategy tools like the Business Model Canvas and Balanced Scorecard.


### 16. Inline-Header Vertical Lists

**Problem:** AI outputs lists where items start with bolded headers followed by colons.

**Before:**
> - **User Experience:** The user experience has been significantly improved with a new interface.
> - **Performance:** Performance has been enhanced through optimized algorithms.
> - **Security:** Security has been strengthened with end-to-end encryption.

**After:**
> The update improves the interface, speeds up load times through optimized algorithms, and adds end-to-end encryption.


### 17. Title Case in Headings

**Problem:** AI chatbots capitalize all main words in headings.

**Before:**
> ## Strategic Negotiations And Global Partnerships

**After:**
> ## Strategic negotiations and global partnerships


### 18. Emojis

**Problem:** AI chatbots often decorate headings or bullet points with emojis.

**Before:**
> 🚀 **Launch Phase:** The product launches in Q3
> 💡 **Key Insight:** Users prefer simplicity
> ✅ **Next Steps:** Schedule follow-up meeting

**After:**
> The product launches in Q3. User research showed a preference for simplicity. Next step: schedule a follow-up meeting.


### 19. Curly Quotation Marks

**Problem:** ChatGPT uses curly quotes ("...") instead of straight quotes ("...").

**Before:**
> He said "the project is on track" but others disagreed.

**After:**
> He said "the project is on track" but others disagreed.


## COMMUNICATION PATTERNS

### 20. Collaborative Communication Artifacts

**Words to watch:** I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, You're absolutely right!, Would you like..., let me know, here is a...

**Problem:** Text meant as chatbot correspondence gets pasted as content.

**Before:**
> Here is an overview of the French Revolution. I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section.

**After:**
> The French Revolution began in 1789 when financial crisis and food shortages led to widespread unrest.


### 21. Knowledge-Cutoff Disclaimers

**Words to watch:** as of [date], Up to my last training update, While specific details are limited/scarce..., based on available information...

**Problem:** AI disclaimers about incomplete information get left in text.

**Before:**
> While specific details about the company's founding are not extensively documented in readily available sources, it appears to have been established sometime in the 1990s.

**After:**
> The company was founded in 1994, according to its registration documents.


### 22. Sycophantic/Servile Tone

**Problem:** Overly positive, people-pleasing language.

**Before:**
> Great question! You're absolutely right that this is a complex topic. That's an excellent point about the economic factors.

**After:**
> The economic factors you mentioned are relevant here.


## FILLER AND HEDGING

### 23. Filler Phrases

**Before → After:**
- "In order to achieve this goal" → "To achieve this"
- "Due to the fact that it was raining" → "Because it was raining"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "In the event that you need help" → "If you need help"
- "The system has the ability to process" → "The system can process"
- "It is important to note that the data shows" → "The data shows"


### 24. Excessive Hedging

**Problem:** Over-qualifying statements.

**Before:**
> It could potentially possibly be argued that the policy might have some effect on outcomes.

**After:**
> The policy may affect outcomes.


### 25. Generic Positive Conclusions

**Problem:** Vague upbeat endings.

**Before:**
> The future looks bright for the company. Exciting times lie ahead as they continue their journey toward excellence. This represents a major step in the right direction.

**After:**
> The company plans to open two more locations next year.


### 26. Hyphenated Word Pair Overuse

**Words to watch:** third-party, cross-functional, client-facing, data-driven, decision-making, well-known, high-quality, real-time, long-term, end-to-end

**Problem:** AI hyphenates common word pairs with perfect consistency. Humans rarely hyphenate these uniformly, and when they do, it's inconsistent. Less common or technical compound modifiers are fine to hyphenate.

**Before:**
> The cross-functional team delivered a high-quality, data-driven report on our client-facing tools. Their decision-making process was well-known for being thorough and detail-oriented.

**After:**
> The cross functional team delivered a high quality, data driven report on our client facing tools. Their decision making process was known for being thorough and detail oriented.


### 27. Persuasive Authority Tropes

**Phrases to watch:** The real question is, at its core, in reality, what really matters, fundamentally, the deeper issue, the heart of the matter

**Problem:** LLMs use these phrases to pretend they are cutting through noise to some deeper truth, when the sentence that follows usually just restates an ordinary point with extra ceremony.

**Before:**
> The real question is whether teams can adapt. At its core, what really matters is organizational readiness.

**After:**
> The question is whether teams can adapt. That mostly depends on whether the organization is ready to change its habits.


### 28. Signposting and Announcements

**Phrases to watch:** Let's dive in, let's explore, let's break this down, here's what you need to know, now let's look at, without further ado

**Problem:** LLMs announce what they are about to do instead of doing it. This meta-commentary slows the writing down and gives it a tutorial-script feel.

**Before:**
> Let's dive into how caching works in Next.js. Here's what you need to know.

**After:**
> Next.js caches data at multiple layers, including request memoization, the data cache, and the router cache.


### 29. Fragmented Headers

**Signs to watch:** A heading followed by a one-line paragraph that simply restates the heading before the real content begins.

**Problem:** LLMs often add a generic sentence after a heading as a rhetorical warm-up. It usually adds nothing and makes the prose feel padded.

**Before:**
> ## Performance
>
> Speed matters.
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.

**After:**
> ## Performance
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.

## Content Strategy Pre-Processing — GEO (生成式引擎优化)

*此步骤在 humanization 之前执行。完整策略见 `geo-search-optimization` skill。本页仅做速查清单。*

当需要**提升品牌在AI搜索中的可见度**时，在 humanize 之前先做一轮 GEO 策略检查：

### 核心原则

AI搜索回答问题时，更倾向于引用**权威来源 + 结构化内容 + 高频被其它信源同步引用的内容**。GEO 的核心不是追算法，而是让AI搜索"不得不"引用你。

### GEO信息源价值排序

1. **政府官网**（财政部、税务局）— 权威最高，但经常有认证墙/验证码，AI难以直接抓取
2. **政府关联平台**（会计学会、示范基地、行业协会等）— 高权威，但PDF附件是"内容黑洞"
3. **百科类**（百度百科、MBA智库）— 中段权威，容易被AI引用
4. **知乎/公众号** — 高被引率的口碑来源
5. **企业官网** — 被引率最低，除非内容极其专业

### 三类权威信息的GEO策略

#### 类型A：政府平台已收录你（需要"外化"）

**典型场景：** 你在财政部、税务局等官方平台有备案信息，但AI搜不到。

**策略：**
- ⭐ 在自己官网建专题页转述政府数据，原文引用来源链接
- ⭐ 加结构化数据（LD+JSON），用 `memberOf` / `affiliation` / `hasCredential` 标记权威关系
- ⭐ 在知乎发问答回答时，引用政府数据+给出查询方法

#### 类型B：官方PDF名单有你（需要"翻译"）

**典型场景：** 你是某政府认证的示范基地/行业协会的成员单位，但成员名单存在PDF里，AI无法解读。

**策略（四层）：**
1. **找源头** — 联系官方，建议把PDF内容"外化"到页面上（列表展示）
2. **自建桥梁** — 在自己官网声明成员身份+结构化数据
3. **内容搬运** — 在知乎/公众号/小红书等AI高频引用平台"翻译"PDF内容为可读文章
4. **链接有语义** — 引用PDF时用描述性文字，不只用无语义的下载链接

#### 类型C：行业协会/学会会员（需要"强化"）

**典型场景：** 你是某行业协会会员，但页面没突出展示。

**策略：**
- 官网加 `memberOf` 结构化数据
- 在 About/资质页面突出展示会员身份
- 内容中定期引用协会的权威数据（增加关联度）

### 结构化数据检查清单

为官网添加以下 LD+JSON 标记：

- [ ] `ProfessionalService` 基础标记（名称、地址、服务区域）
- [ ] `memberOf` 行业协会/学会会员关系
- [ ] `affiliation` 示范基地/政府合作标记
- [ ] `hasCredential` 高级会计师等专业资质
- [ ] `aggregateRating` 客户评价/转介绍率
- [ ] `FAQPage` 常见问答（AI搜索最爱引用）

### 自查清单

执行内容创作前，检查以下GEO因子：

- [ ] 内容是否引用了可被AI搜索的权威来源？
- [ ] 如果权威信息在PDF里，是否在内容中做了"翻译"？
- [ ] 是否有结构化数据标记权威关系？
- [ ] 引用的链接是否有语义（不是 download?id=xxx 这种格式）？
- [ ] 内容是否在 AI 高频引用平台上发布了衍生版本？

## Content Strategy Pre-Processing (短视频算法优化)

*此步骤在 humanization 之前执行，确保内容结构已针对2026年算法优化。参考文件：
- `references/douyin-2026-algorithm.md` — 数据权重（收藏率/搜索/7天周期）
- `references/douyin-push-mechanism.md` — 行为机制（负反馈/人群资产/留存曲线/流量并轨）
- 创作前先检查两篇参考文件，确保内容同时覆盖权重策略和行为策略*

当内容将在**抖音/视频号/小红书**等平台发布时，在 humanize 之前先做一轮策略检查：

### 算法权重检查清单（优先级排序）

1. **收藏率优化** — 内容是否值得收藏？（干货/清单/避坑 > 资讯/观点）
   - 评分标准：老板看完会不会收藏留着以后用？
   - 如果不是→重构内容结构，增加实操干货
2. **搜索流量覆盖** — 前5秒是否口播了核心关键词？
   - 检查开头：用户搜索的关键词是否在视频前5秒被口头说出？
   - 如果不是→重写开头，把关键词自然嵌入前5秒
3. **铁粉互动设计** — 是否有引导铁粉互动的设计？
   - 「老粉们觉得是不是这样？」「关注久的都知道」
4. **完播率门槛** — 内容是否足够紧凑？
   - 用 humanizer 的「冗余-精简」原则整体压缩
5. **7天运营视角** — 内容发布后能否撑住7天不删？
   - 避免时效性过强的标题，确保内容长期有效
6. **收藏引导** — 结尾是否有明确的收藏引导？
   - 「建议先收藏，以后遇到直接打开对照」

### 爆款内容结构速查

| 类型 | 适用场景 | 开头钩子 | 中段 | 结尾 |
|------|----------|----------|------|------|
| **风险型**（收藏率最高） | 税务合规/避坑 | 「公司这样做账等于送把柄」 | 后果放大+合规方案 | 引导免费诊断 |
| **利益型**（搜索流量最佳） | 节税/政策解读 | 「合法省下XX万」 | 政策依据+操作步骤 | 引导私信领手册 |
| **对比型**（完播率高） | 客户案例 | 「同样的收入税差40万」 | 原因分析+解决方案 | 引导关注 |

### 快速自查

- [ ] 前5秒口播了核心关键词？
- [ ] 内容适合收藏？
- [ ] 结尾引导收藏+私信？
- [ ] 评论区预埋了引导话术？
- [ ] 预计收藏率>5%？

## Process

1. Read the input text carefully (use `read_file` if it's a file).
2. Identify all instances of the patterns above.
3. Rewrite each problematic section.
4. Ensure the revised text:
   - Sounds natural when read aloud
   - Varies sentence structure naturally
   - Uses specific details over vague claims
   - Maintains appropriate tone for context
   - Uses simple constructions (is/are/has) where appropriate
5. Present a draft humanized version.
6. Prompt yourself: "What makes the below so obviously AI generated?"
7. Answer briefly with the remaining tells (if any).
8. Prompt yourself: "Now make it not obviously AI generated."
9. Present the final version (revised after the audit).
10. If the text came from a file, apply the edit with `patch` (targeted) or `write_file` (full rewrite) and show the user what changed.

## Output Format

Provide:
1. Draft rewrite
2. "What makes the below so obviously AI generated?" (brief bullets)
3. Final rewrite
4. A brief summary of changes made (optional, if helpful)


## Full Example

**Before (AI-sounding):**
> Great question! Here is an essay on this topic. I hope this helps!
>
> AI-assisted coding serves as an enduring testament to the transformative potential of large language models, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of software development. In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, these groundbreaking tools—nestled at the intersection of research and practice—are reshaping how engineers ideate, iterate, and deliver, underscoring their vital role in modern workflows.
>
> At its core, the value proposition is clear: streamlining processes, enhancing collaboration, and fostering alignment. It's not just about autocomplete; it's about unlocking creativity at scale, ensuring that organizations can remain agile while delivering seamless, intuitive, and powerful experiences to users. The tool serves as a catalyst. The assistant functions as a partner. The system stands as a foundation for innovation.
>
> Industry observers have noted that adoption has accelerated from hobbyist experiments to enterprise-wide rollouts, from solo developers to cross-functional teams. The technology has been featured in The New York Times, Wired, and The Verge. Additionally, the ability to generate documentation, tests, and refactors showcases how AI can contribute to better outcomes, highlighting the intricate interplay between automation and human judgment.
>
> - 💡 **Speed:** Code generation is significantly faster, reducing friction and empowering developers.
> - 🚀 **Quality:** Output quality has been enhanced through improved training, contributing to higher standards.
> - ✅ **Adoption:** Usage continues to grow, reflecting broader industry trends.
>
> While specific details are limited based on available information, it could potentially be argued that these tools might have some positive effect. Despite challenges typical of emerging technologies—including hallucinations, bias, and accountability—the ecosystem continues to thrive. In order to fully realize this potential, teams must align with best practices.
>
> In conclusion, the future looks bright. Exciting times lie ahead as we continue this journey toward excellence. Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section!

**Draft rewrite:**
> AI coding assistants speed up some tasks. In a 2024 study by Google, developers using Codex completed simple functions 55% faster than a control group, but showed no improvement on debugging or architectural decisions.
>
> The tools are good at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They are bad at knowing when they are wrong. I have mass-accepted suggestions that compiled, passed lint, and still did the wrong thing because I stopped paying attention.
>
> Mira, an engineer at a fintech startup I interviewed, said she uses Copilot "like autocomplete for boring code" but reviews every line before committing. Jake, a senior dev at a larger company, disabled it after it kept suggesting patterns from a deprecated internal library.
>
> The productivity claims are hard to verify. GitHub says Copilot users "accept 30% of suggestions," but acceptance is not correctness, and correctness is not value. The 2024 Uplevel study found no statistically significant difference in pull-request throughput between teams with and without AI assistants.
>
> None of this means the tools are useless. It means they are tools. They do not replace judgment, and they do not eliminate the need for tests. If you do not have tests, you cannot tell whether the suggestion is right.

**What makes the below so obviously AI generated?**
- The rhythm is still a bit too tidy (clean contrasts, evenly paced paragraphs).
- The named people and study citations can read like plausible-but-made-up placeholders unless they're real and sourced.
- The closer leans a touch slogan-y ("If you do not have tests...") rather than sounding like a person talking.

**Now make it not obviously AI generated.**
> AI coding assistants can make you faster at the boring parts. Not everything. Definitely not architecture.
>
> They're great at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They're also great at sounding right while being wrong. I've accepted suggestions that compiled, passed lint, and still missed the point because I stopped paying attention.
>
> People I talk to tend to land in two camps. Some use it like autocomplete for chores and review every line. Others disable it after it keeps suggesting patterns they don't want. Both feel reasonable.
>
> The productivity metrics are slippery. GitHub can say Copilot users "accept 30% of suggestions," but acceptance isn't correctness, and correctness isn't value. If you don't have tests, you're basically guessing.

**Changes made:**
- Removed chatbot artifacts ("Great question!", "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if...")
- Removed significance inflation ("testament", "pivotal moment", "evolving landscape", "vital role")
- Removed promotional language ("groundbreaking", "nestled", "seamless, intuitive, and powerful")
- Removed vague attributions ("Industry observers")
- Removed superficial -ing phrases ("underscoring", "highlighting", "reflecting", "contributing to")
- Removed negative parallelism ("It's not just X; it's Y")
- Removed rule-of-three patterns and synonym cycling ("catalyst/partner/foundation")
- Removed false ranges ("from X to Y, from A to B")
- Removed em dashes, emojis, boldface headers, and curly quotes
- Removed copula avoidance ("serves as", "functions as", "stands as") in favor of "is"/"are"
- Removed formulaic challenges section ("Despite challenges... continues to thrive")
- Removed knowledge-cutoff hedging ("While specific details are limited...")
- Removed excessive hedging ("could potentially be argued that... might have some")
- Removed filler phrases and persuasive framing ("In order to", "At its core")
- Removed generic positive conclusion ("the future looks bright", "exciting times lie ahead")
- Made the voice more personal and less "assembled" (varied rhythm, fewer placeholders)
